epsilon-range
=============
Utility for determining if a number belongs to a range.

npm bundle incoming, until then, `git clone https://github.org/mzdv/epsilon-range.git" and use the `epsilon-range.js` file

`app.js` contains tests for the library (just `console.log`'s, I didn't want to deploy a testing framework)
